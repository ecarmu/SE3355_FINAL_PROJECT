I used 6 hotels totally... 3 of them from Turkey and 3 of them from USA

If not logged in, user views all the hotels
If looged in, only hotels which are in the country of the user will be shown

Searchboxes can filter data seperately or together... you don't have to enter data to all searchboxes...

About MVC:
- Model: My "hotels.db" and "users.db" are my databases... Also My "useAuth" stores data as sessinStorage
- Controller: My app.py is my controller. It gets the data from the view and from the database. It is the backend of my project and all the tasks are handled there... view only gets the result coming from database and contoller
- View: I had 4 pages: Login, Home, Detail, SearchResults. These pages just has boxes which users interact with it
